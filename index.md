_ABOUT ME_[^1]


Hello everyone out there! I'm Patricia Rodríguez Vaquero. I'm currently doing a Postgraduate Course about Big Data & Analytics at
Universidad Carlos III of Madrid. While studying for my studies I'm also doing an internship as a Business Intelligence Analyst in
Stratebi Business Solutions. In my spare time, I really enjoy learning and reading from different [resources](https://twitter.com/patri_vaquero_/status/1250537093991927811). I'm very active in social networks because I'd like to keep up to date in everything related to Data Science and Technology. I'm a little bit nerdy! :D

I'm graduated in Business Management (with the Area of Specialization in Data Analytics) and oriented to the Business Analytics area. 
With the desire to not stop learning and with the aim of focusing my professional future in the area of DDDM (Data-Driven Decision 
Making), the data analysis in charge of converting the data set into key information for innovation and decision making in a dynamic 
environment, as it is today for any company, marked by the need for an integral vision of the business in order to always keep up with 
the constant opportunities required by the era of Digital Transformation.

Especially interested in all the areas in charge of this transformation process BBDD -> Information -> Decisions: Data Science, Business 
Intelligence & Analytics, Machine Learning, Predictive Modelling, etc.

I  consider  myself  hard-working,  self-demanding, perseverant,  competitive,  and  with  a  lot  of  desire  for  new challenges  and  opportunities. 

My desire of aventures and to learn, encourage me to do an Erasmus in Tampere University in Finland during 2019, having the opportunity 
to improve my English and becoming more independent and responsible.

I am open to new opportunities and willing to achieve my dreams.

ATTITUDE IS THE KEY TO SUCCESS!
